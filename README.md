# Transcribed Speech Dataset Simulation

The goal of this project is to create a dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, simulating text obtained from a speech recognition system in the Russian language. The dataset will be generated from various sources, including the CommonVoice dataset in Russian from Mozilla, autogenerated YouTube subtitles for audiobooks, and pre-made datasets such as WikiANN and MultiNERD.

## Files

### multiprocessing_converter.py

`multiprocessing_converter.py` is the converter script used to transcribe the entire Russian CommonVoice dataset. It utilizes the Vosk library for speech recognition and conversion. This script employs multiprocessing techniques to enhance efficiency in processing a large number of audio files.

### full_table.csv

`full_table.csv` contains the results of the CommonVoice dataset conversion. It includes the transcribed text from the Russian CommonVoice audio files, differences vs the original text, and any otherrelevant metadata.

Please note that as this project is a work in progress, additional files and details will be added as the dataset simulation progresses.
